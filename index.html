        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This project was brought to Analytic Architects by the executive sponsor, David Norgard, to assist the W&C (W&C) firm in creating a time tracking and scheduling solution that is accurate and scalable. This project will enable the firm’s lawyers to accurately track and assign their work hours to clients for more transparent billing. Additionally, the firm’s clients will use the project to view the invoices received from W&C. The primary stakeholders of this project are W&C leadership, W&C employees, W&C clients, Analytic Architects project management team, Analytic Architects developers and IT teams, and W&C external auditors. </p>
        <p>For the project to be successful, the following three objectives must be achieved:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Develop a robust system that ensures accurate and complete timekeeping.</li>
            <li>Create a scheduling system capable of preventing time waste and scheduling conflicts.</li>
            <li>Develop a system that produces up-to-date billing documents with high readability.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The timeline for this project is 14 months with the following critical milestones:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Requirements Document, 2023-10-18</li>
            <li>Use cases, domain models, and UIs prepared, 2023-10-27</li>
            <li>Final report completed, 2023-11-14</li>
            <li>Final presentation, 2023-11-15</li>
            <li>Website operational, 2024-06-01</li>
            <li>Mobile application operational, 2024-08-01</li>
            <li>Invoice system delivered, 2024-10-01</li>
            <li>Scheduling system delivered, 2024-12-01</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The key risks associated with this project are the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Technical challenges during development: Complex problems may arise during development, requiring proactive planning and training.</li>
            <li>Resistance to change by W&C employees: Training materials and change management strategies will be provided to address employee hesitancy.</li>
            <li>Website and mobile designs have low ease of use: Regular discussions with project sponsors and usability evaluations will prevent design issues from compounding.</li>
        </ul>
